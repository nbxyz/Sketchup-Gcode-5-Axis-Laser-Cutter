# SketchUp Ruby API Stubs

Auto-generated stubs for the SketchUp Ruby API. Useful for IDE intellisense and auto-complete.

This is currently a work in progress and it may change a lot in the near future.

The stubs are automatically generated by a YARD template which we will publish in our sketchup-yard-template repository: https://github.com/SketchUp/sketchup-yard-template

We are experimenting with allowing pull requests to this repository. You can make changes to the `.rb` files in the `SketchUp` folder and send us a pull request.

If you send a pull request, please test the changed by building the documentation first. Make sure you have the Yard gem installed; `gem install yard`. From the location where you clone this repository, run `yardoc`.

Guidance on how to set up editors to use the stubs will come.
